## Introduction to R for Applied Epidemiology and Public Health


### Welcome

Welcome to the live course "Introduction to R for applied epidemiologists", offered by [Applied Epi](www.appliedepi.org) - a nonprofit organisation that offers open-source tools, training, and support to frontline public health practitioners.  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/logo.png")
```

### Data cleaning  

This exercise focuses on **grouping and summarizing data in descriptive tables**.

### Format

This exercise will guide you through a set of tasks.  
*You should perform these tasks in RStudio and on your local computer*.  

#### Getting Help  

There are several ways to get help:  

1) Look for the "helpers" (see below)
2) Ask your live course instructor/facilitator for help  
3) Ask a colleague or other participant in the course for tips  
4) Post a question in [Applied Epi Community](www.community.appliedepi.org) in the category for questions about Applied Epi Training  

Here is what those "helpers" will look like:

    district == "Bolo"
  )
```

Here is more explanation about why the solution works.

#### Quiz questions  

Please complete the quiz questions that you encounter throughout the tutorial. **Answering will help you** to comprehend the material, and will also help us to improve the exercises for future students.  

To practice, please answer the following questions:  


```{r quiz-use-helper, echo=F}
quiz(
  question_radio("When should I view the red 'helper' code?",
    answer("After trying to write the code myself", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Before I try coding", correct = FALSE),
    correct = "Reviewing best-practice code after trying to write yourself can help you improve",
    incorrect = "Please attempt the exercise yourself, or use the hint, before viewing the answer."
  )
)
```


```{r quiz-anxious, echo = FALSE}
question_numeric(
 "How anxious are you about beginning this tutorial - on a scale from 1 (least anxious) to 10 (most anxious)?",
 answer(10, message = "Try not to worry, we will help you succeed!", correct = T),
 answer(9, message = "Try not to worry, we will help you succeed!", correct = T),
 answer(8, message = "Try not to worry, we will help you succeed!", correct = T),
 answer(7, message = "Try not to worry, we will help you succeed!", correct = T),
 answer(6, message = "Ok, we will get there together", correct = T),
 answer(5, message = "Ok, we will get there together", correct = T),
 answer(4, message = "I like your confidence!", correct = T),
 answer(3, message = "I like your confidence!", correct = T),
 answer(2, message = "I like your confidence!", correct = T),
 answer(1, message = "I like your confidence!", correct = T),
 allow_retry = TRUE,
 correct = "Thanks for sharing. ",
 min = 1,
 max = 10,
 step = 1
)
```



#### Icons  

You will see these icons throughout the exercises:

Icon  |Meaning
------|--------------------
`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("eye", style = "solid"), scale = 2, fill = "darkblue")`|Observe  
`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("exclamation", style = "solid"), scale = 2, fill = "red")`|Alert!  
`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("pen", style = "solid"), scale = 2, fill = "brown")`|An informative note  
`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("terminal", style = "solid"), scale = 2, fill = "black")`|Time for you to code!  
`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("window-restore", style = "solid"), scale = 2, fill = "darkgrey")`|Change to another window  
`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("bookmark", style = "solid"), scale = 2, fill = "orange")`|Remember this for later  










## Learning objectives

In this exercise you will:  

* Group data using {dplyr} functions `group_by()`, `summarise()`, and `count()`  
* Make descriptive tables with the {janitor} `tabyl()` and `adorn_()` functions  
* Make descriptive tables with the {gtsummary} function `tbl_summary()`  
* Convert basic R tables into HTML with {flextable}  




## Prepare for analysis  

### Open the R project  


`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("window-restore", style = "solid"), scale = 2, fill = "darkgrey")`  

Open the RStudio by clicking on the "intro_course" R project, as before. Open your script: "ebola_analysis.R" where you wrote the cleaning code from the previous module.  


### Add packages  

Ensure that the following packages are included in the `pacman::p_load()` command at the top of your script:  

* janitor  
* flextable  
* gtsummary  
* scales  

**However, ensure that the {tidyverse} package is still listed last in this command**.  


Now, when you run this command, these packages will be installed (if not already) and loaded for use.

<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: red;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("check", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "red")`Click to see a solution (try it yourself first!)</summary>
</br>

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
pacman::p_load(
  rio,          # for importing data
  here,         # for locating files
  skimr,        # for reviewing the data
  janitor,      # for data cleaning  
  lubridate,    # for date cleaning  
  epikit,       # creating age categories
  gtsummary,    # creating tables  
  scales,       # percents in tables  
  flextable,    # for making pretty tables
  tidyverse     # for data management and visualization
)
```

Don't forget to write `pacman::p_load()`, which loads the {pacman} package to be able to load all the other packages.  
</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->




### Run your R script  

Run all the code in your script. If you have successfully finished the previous modules, this will do the following:  

* Load packages  
* Import the "raw" surveillance dataset  
* Run a series of descriptive analyses to review the data  
* Clean the `surv_raw` "raw" data frame, in a "pipe chain", and save the clean data frame as `surv`  

**Now you can write more code at the bottom of the script, using the cleaned data frame `surv`**


### Add a new section  

Ensure that your script is well-commented (#) so that it is easy to know what is happening in each part of the script.  

If you do not yet have a header over the cleaning section of your script, add one now. It could look something like this:  

```{eval = F, echo=T, results = "asis"}
# Cleaning the raw data
#######################
```

Everyone develops their own style for adding comments and using the hash (#) symbol. For example, this style is also an option:  

```{r, echo= T, eval= F, results = "asis"}
#################################
###   Cleaning the raw data   ###
#################################
```

Just make sure that yours is easy for someone else to read.  

**Now, add a header for a section called "descriptive summary tables".**  





## {janitor} functions  

Often, we want just a quick tabulation of counts of a categorical variable, or simply to know "what are the unique values" in a particular column.  

The `tabyl()` function from {janitor} does this quickly by tabulating columns provided to it. Easy customization can follow, using the related `adorn_()` functions.  

**Try making a simple `tabyl()` of the column `gender`**

<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: darkgreen;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("lightbulb", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "darkgold")` Click to read a hint</summary>
</br>

Pipe the clean `surv` data frame into `tabyl()` and write the column `district` in the parentheses.

</br>
</details>

</br>

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
surv %>% 
  tabyl(district)
```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->

```{r quiz-tabyl}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - tabyl()",
  question("What is the district with the most cases recorded?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("Mountain Rural", correct = T),
    answer("West II"),
    answer("Central II"),
    answer("Manhattan")
  )
)
```



### Adorn formatting  

{janitor} includes a series of "adorn" functions that you can pipe this table into, which will make the formatting nicer.  

**Add the following functions, *in this order***. Observe what each step does, one-at-a-time.  

* `adorn_totals()`  
* `adorn_pct_formatting()`  



### Sorting  

Currently, the table of districts is sorted alphabetically by district name. Change this by piping the result into the {dplyr} function `arrange()` and specifying to sort on column `n` descending.  


<!--
NOTE: Below is the solution (all within details tags collapsed)
-->

<details>
<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: red;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("check", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "red")`Click to see a solution (try it yourself first!)</summary>
</br>

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
surv %>% 
  tabyl(district) %>% 
  adorn_totals() %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->

**Think about the order of your steps... what happens if you add `adorn_totals()` *before* arranging by column `n`?**  

**Re-arrange your steps** so that the rows are in descending order by `n`, but the Total row remains at the bottom.

<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: red;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("check", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "red")`Click to see a solution (try it yourself first!)</summary>
</br>

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
surv %>% 
  tabyl(district) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  adorn_totals() %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting()
```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->



### Cross-tabulation  

**Now try to cross-tabulate district and hospital.**  

<!--
NOTE: Below is the solution (all within details tags collapsed)

<details>
<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: red;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("check", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "red")`Click to see a solution (try it yourself first!)</summary>
</br>

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
surv %>% 
  tabyl(district, hospital)
```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->

```{r quiz-tabyl2}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - hospital tabulation",
  question("Based on this cross-tabulation, which district is SMMH likely located in?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("West II"),
    answer("Central II"),
    answer("Mountain Rural", correct = T),
    answer("East I")
  )
)
```


Try to add `adorn_()` functions below. See how they behave slightly differently on cross-tabulations than they did on tabulation of a single column.  

* `adorn_totals()`  
* `adorn_percentages()`  
* `adorn_pct_formatting()`  
* `adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 0)`  


Then try adding these functions (only one at a time):  

* `adorn_ns()`  
* `adorn_ns("rear")`  
* `adorn_ns("front)`  


**Final tabyl() exercise**  

Explore the data frame with `tabyl()`. Choose 2 tables to include in your R script that showcase your new abilities to use `tabyl()`.  










## {dplyr} functions  

### `count()`  

The {dplyr} function `count()` provides a simple alternative way to tabulate counts.  

**Try running this code:**  

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
surv %>% 
  count(district)
```

How does it compare to the simple `tabyl()` on the same column?  


**Now, adjust the command so that instead of printing, the output is saved as a new data frame named `district_counts`.**  

This is just to show you, that you in are in fact creating another data frame! You could conduct analyses on this data frame, or even export it as a csv or xlsx file.

</br>

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
district_counts <- surv %>% 
  count(district)
```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->




**Now try entering 2 categorical columns into the `count()` command, like `district` and `gender`** (separated by a comma).  



<!--

<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: red;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("check", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "red")`Click to see a solution (try it yourself first!)</summary>
</br>

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
surv %>% 
  count(district, gender)
```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->


What does this table look like? How does it compare to the cross-tabulation feature of `tabyl()`? What might be some advantages or disadvantages of this "long" format?  

**Which of the two formats better adheres to the guidelines of "tidy data"?** (remember, each variable gets its own column, each observation gets its own row...)  





### `group_by()` and `summarise()`  

The functions `group_by()` and `summarise()` together are the most versatile tool to make a new summary data frame to hold summary statistics.  

One major advantage of `summarise()` is the ability to return more customized statistical summaries like `median()`, `mean()`, `max()`, `min()`, `sd()` (standard deviation), percentiles, and the number/percent of rows that meet certain logical criteria. 


### Summary statistics  

**Try this command below**. It should produce exactly the same table as you made with `count()`.  

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
surv %>% 
  group_by(district) %>% 
  summarise(n_rows = n())
```

You might wonder why anyone would write the command this way, when they could simply write `count()`? The answer is that you can add more lines within `summarise()` that will create new calculated summary columns.  

* The `n_rows` is the *name we are designating for a new column in the summary dataset  
* The `= n()` is a function `n()` that counts the number of rows (in this case, within the *group*/district)  

Regard below how 3 new columns are created, each with their respective calculations:  

```{r, echo=T, eval = T}
surv %>% 
  group_by(district) %>% 
  summarise(
    n_rows  = n(),                           # use function n() to count the number of rows
    age_avg = mean(age_years, na.rm = T),    # mean age in the group
    max_onset = max(date_onset, na.rm=T)     # latest onset date
)
```

In the later two rows, within the statistical functions, the column to be used is listed (e.g. `age_years`) and any other relevant arguments (e.g. `na.rm = TRUE` for most mathematical functions).  


### Logical criteria using `sum()`  

You can use `sum()` within `summarise()` to return the number of rows that meet a logical criteria. The expression within is counted if it evaluates to TRUE. For example:

* `sum(age_years < 18, na.rm=T)`  
* `sum(gender == "male", na.rm=T)`  
* `sum(response %in% c("Likely", "Very Likely"))`

Note the use of `na.rm = TRUE` within mathematical functions like `sum()`, otherwise `NA` will be returned if there are any missing values in the assessed values.  

**Write a `summarise()` command that returns, for each `hospital`, the number of female cases.**  



<!--
NOTE: Below is the solution (all within details tags collapsed)
-->

<details>
<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: red;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("check", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "red")`Click to see a solution (try it yourself first!)</summary>
</br>

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
surv %>% 
  group_by(hospital) %>% 
  summarise(fem = sum(gender == "female", na.rm = TRUE))
```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->

**What would you change to the calculation to the number of male cases?** What about the number of cases with unknown/missing gender? (hint: it involves using ` = sum(is.na(gender), na.rm=T)`)  








### Percents  


Once you begin calculating these columns, you may want to divide one by another, to create a percent.  

Once you have defined a column within `summarise()`, you can reference in *lower* parts of the same `summarise()` command. For example:  

* You calculate the total number of cases per hospital, and call it `n_cases`  
* You calculate the number of male cases per hospital, and call it `males`  
* You calculate the proportion male using the two previous  

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
surv %>% 
  group_by(hospital) %>% 
  summarise(
    n_cases   = n(),
    males     = sum(gender == "male", na.rm=T),
    males_pct = males/n_cases
  )
```

What does that percent look like? Is it really a percent? Or more of a (decimal) proportion?  

There is a function you can use to quickly transform this proportion into a percent - it is the function `percent()` from the package {scales}.  

**Try this now**  

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
surv %>% 
  group_by(hospital) %>% 
  summarise(
    n_cases   = n(),
    males     = sum(gender == "male", na.rm=T),
    males_pct = percent(males/n_cases)
  )
```

For more details, see the chapter on Descriptive tables in the [Epi R Handbook](https://epirhandbook.com/en/descriptive-tables.html#dplyr-package).  


### Rounding  

If you need to round a number produced by `summarise()`, wrap it in the function `round()` and use argument `digits = ` to adjust the number of decimals.  

Try running this code, with, and without the `round()` function:  

```{r, echo=T}
surv %>% 
  group_by(hospital) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_age = round(mean(age_years, na.rm = T), digits = 0)
  )
```

As you remove `round()`, don't forget to also remove the comma and `digits = 0`, which are the second argument of that function. 



### Conditional statistics

One of the more advanced calculation tools you can use are subsetting brackets `[ ]`. These symbols can be used after a column and will filter it according to whatever logical criteria you write inside.  

For example, `max_temp_fvr = max(temp[fever == "yes"], na.rm = T)` will return the maximum temperature recorded in the group, *but only among the cases that did report a fever*.  

It is a complicated command - ask your facilitator if you do not understand it.  



### Final exercise  

Create a data frame that summarises the following, for each district:  

* Number of cases  
* The percent of cases that were female  
* The most recent onset date  
* Number of cases under age 5 years  
* The percent of cases that reported vomiting  
* The maximum weight, *among male cases*  

Be sure to write this command in your R script, and adjust your command to save this data frame in your R Environment as `district_info`, to keep for later.

When making a complex summary table with {dplyr}, be sure to read the chapter in the [Epi R Handbook](https://epirhandbook.com/en/descriptive-tables.html#dplyr-package), as there are details that we did not have time to cover here.  



## {flextable}  

The {flextable} package can accept a data frame in R and convert it into an HTML table that can be saved as a pretty table file.  

This is useful if you create a table with {janitor} or with {dplyr}, but want to put it in an HTML report, a Word document or PDF, or even just print it as a PNG image.  

### qflextable()  

The most simple command from {flextable} is `qflextable`, which stands for "quick flextable". It makes some fast ratio and formatting adjustments, and transforms the table. **Look for it to appear in your RStudio Viewer pane.**  

```{r, echo=T}
surv %>% 
  group_by(hospital) %>%                                     # get statistics for each hospital
  summarise(
    n_cases   = n(),                                         # number of rows (cases)
    max_onset = max(date_onset, na.rm = T),                  # latest onset date
    under5    = sum(age_years <= 5, na.rm = T),              # number of children under 5
    vomit_n   = sum(vomit == "yes", na.rm=T),                # number vomiting
    vomit_pct = percent(vomit_n / n_cases),                  # percent vomiting
    max_wt_male = max(wt_kg[gender == "male"], na.rm = T)) %>%     # max weight among men
  qflextable()
```


Try the same thing with one of your {janitor} tables.  


There are a lot of further adjustments that you can make to your flextable. See the [Tables for presentation chapter of the Epi R Handbook](https://epirhandbook.com/en/tables-for-presentation.html#tables-for-presentation).  


Here is one example, of a different table, used in the Handbook:  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/flextable.png")

### Saving an image  

You can export the tables to Word, PowerPoint or HTML or as an image (PNG) files. To do this, save the table as a named object using the assignment operator `<-`. Then, place that object in one of the below {flextable} function, as shown.  

* `save_as_docx()`  
* `save_as_pptx()`  
* `save_as_image()`  
* `save_as_html()`  

Within the parentheses of the command, provide the name of the table object in  (e.g. `my_table`), and then the file path to save to (including the file name), for example:  

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
# saves the file as my_table.docx in the root folder of your R project
save_as_docx(my_table, path = "my_table.docx")
```

or this:  


```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
# saves the file as my_table.png in the root folder of your R project
save_as_image(my_table, path = "my_table.png")
```

Note that you will need to install Phantom JS (free) for the `save_as_image()` to work. You can do this by running the command `webshot::install_phantomjs()`.  



## {gtsummary} functions  

The final approach that you should practice is with the {gtsummary} function `tbl_summary`.  

This package aims to produce *publication-ready images* with very simple and short code. Indeed, you *can* make very complex and detailed adjustments to these tables, but it is also easy to get a sharp table with very little code.  

### Select columns  

The important difference from the previous methods is that you should first `select()` only the columns that you want to use in the table.  

**Pipe `surv` into `select()`, select two columns, and pipe into `tbl_summary()`**  

What was produced for the categorical variables?  

What was produced for the continuous variables?  

### Stratified tables  

You can also add a `by = ` argument to the `tbl_summary()` command, and designate a column to stratify the table (in columns). Do not forget to include this column in the `select()` command above!  

**Try to make a table that assesses `district`, `age_cat`, all of the symptoms columns, weight, and height**  

**Now make the same table, stratified by `gender`.**

<details>
<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: red;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("check", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "red")`Click to see a solution (try it yourself first!)</summary>
</br>

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
surv %>% 
  select(district, age_cat, fever, chills, cough, aches, vomit, wt_kg, ht_cm, gender) %>% 
  tbl_summary(by = gender)
```

</br>
</details>
